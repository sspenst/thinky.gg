# New Relic Next.js instrumentation 
[![npm status badge][5]][6] [![Next.js Instrumentation CI][1]][2] [![codecov][7]][8]

This is New Relic's official Next.js framework instrumentation for use with the New Relic [Node.js agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic).

This module is a dependency of the agent and is installed by default when you install the agent.

This module provides instrumentation for server-side rendering via [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware), and New Relic transaction naming for both page and server requests. It does not provide any instrumentation for actions occurring during build or in client-side code.  If you want telemetry data on actions occurring on the client (browser), you can [inject the browser agent](./docs/inject-browser-agent.md).

Here are documents for more in-depth explanations about [transaction naming](./docs/transactions.md), [segments/spans](./docs/segments-and-spans.md), and [injecting the browser agent](./docs/inject-browser-agent.md).

**Note**: The minimum supported Next.js version is [12.0.9](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.0.9).  If you are using Next.js middleware the minimum supported version is [12.2.0](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.2.0).

## Installation

Typically, most users use the version auto-installed by the agent. You can see agent install instructions [here](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#installation-and-getting-started).

In some cases, installing a specific version is ideal. For example, new features or major changes might be released via a major version update to this module, prior to inclusion in the main New Relic Node.js agent.

```
npm install @newrelic/next
```

```js
NODE_OPTIONS='-r @newrelic/next' next start
```

If you cannot control how your program is run, you can load the `@newrelic/next` module before any other module in your program. However, we strongly suggest you avoid this method at all costs.  We found bundling when running `next build` causes problems and also will make your bundle unnecessarily large.

```js
require('@newrelic/next')

/* ... the rest of your program ... */
```

### Custom Next.js servers

If you are using next as a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server), you're probably not running your application with the `next` CLI.  In that scenario we recommend running the Next.js instrumentation as follows.

```js
node -r @newrelic/next your-program.js
```

For more information, please see the agent [installation guide][3].

## Getting Started

Our [API and developer documentation](http://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/) for writing instrumentation will be of help. We particularly recommend the tutorials and various "shim" API documentation.

## Client-side Instrumentation

Next.js is a full stack React Framework. This module augments the Node.js New Relic agent, thus any client-side actions will not be instrumented. However, below is a method of adding the [New Relic Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) to get more information on client-side actions.

The most appropriate approach would be to follow the [beforeInteractive strategy](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script#beforeinteractive).  Put the following in your `pages/_document.ts`

```ts
const newrelic = require('newrelic');
import Document, {
  DocumentContext,
  DocumentInitialProps,
  Html,
  Head,
  Main,
  NextScript,
} from 'next/document';
import Script from 'next/script';

type DocumentProps = {
  browserTimingHeader: string
}

class MyDocument extends Document<DocumentProps> {
  static async getInitialProps(
    ctx: DocumentContext
  ): Promise<DocumentInitialProps> {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);

    const browserTimingHeader = newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader({
      hasToRemoveScriptWrapper: true,
    });

    return {
      ...initialProps,
      browserTimingHeader,
    };
  }

  render() {
    const { browserTimingHeader } = this.props

    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>{/* whatever you need here */}</Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
          <Script
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: browserTimingHeader }}
            strategy="beforeInteractive"
          ></Script>
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

For static compiled pages, you can use the [copy-paste method](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#copy-paste-app) for enabling the New Relic Browser agent.

For more information, please see the agent [compatibility and requirements][4].

### Error Handling

For capturing both the client and server side errors it is best to use `pages/_error.js` pattern recommended by Next.js documentation on [Advanced Error Page Customization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#more-advanced-error-page-customizing)

This pattern can be used to send either client, server or both types of errors to New Relic.

```js
function Error({ statusCode }) {
  return (
    <p>
      {statusCode
        ? `An error ${statusCode} occurred on server`
        : "An error occurred on client"}
    </p>
  );
}

Error.getInitialProps = ({ res, err }) => {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    const newrelic = require('newrelic');
    newrelic.noticeError(err);
  } else {
    window.newrelic.noticeError(err);
  }

  const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : 404;
  return { statusCode };
};

export default Error;
```

The example above assumes that both the New Relic Browser and Node.js agents are [integrated](#client-side-instrumentation). The `getInitialProps` function's `if` statement checks whether an error was thrown on the server side (`typeof window === "undefined"`) and if it was the case, it `requires` New Relic Node.js agent and sends an `err` with `noticeError` method. Otherwise it assumes the error was thrown on the front-end side, and uses the browser agent to send the error to New Relic by using `window.newrelic.noticeError(err)`.

## Testing

The module includes a suite of unit and functional tests which should be used to
verify that your changes don't break existing functionality.

All tests are stored in `tests/` and are written using
[Tap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap) with the extension `.test.js` (unit), or `.tap.js` (versioned).

To run the full suite, run: `npm test`.

Individual test scripts include:

```
npm run unit
npm run versioned
```
