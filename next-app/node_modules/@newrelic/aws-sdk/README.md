New Relic's official AWS SDK package instrumentation for use with [the Node.js agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic). Provides instrumentation for the [AWS SDK (`aws-sdk`)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) npm package.

## Installation

This package is [a dependency of the the Node Agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/2121ffdc5001ea1bf9ab473138b9446c1f2a7eef/package.json#L147), and the average user should not need to install it manually.
